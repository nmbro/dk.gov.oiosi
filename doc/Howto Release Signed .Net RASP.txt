Work has gone into make a signed release og RASP .Net.
However, we have the problem that the virtual build server can't reach the code Signing certificate on physical USB eToken.
Therefore, the only option so far, is release a signed version from a workstation.
These steps explain howto setup the workstation to release a signed version of RASP.Net.

1) Add (if not already exist) to windows Enviroment, the password to the certificate (yes, the key start with '-'):
   Name		-DigstSignToolPassword
   Password not added to SVN.


2) Add (if not already exist) to windows Enviroment, the key and Hash to the certificate (yes, the key start with '-'):
   Name		-DigstSPCThumbprint
   VAlue	98642f19b787ec0386db8b52ce9e8ed4e49c

3) Install (if not already done) SAFENET DRIVERS: https://www.trustzone.com/standard-code-signing (step 1).
