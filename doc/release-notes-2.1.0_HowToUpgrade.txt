How to upgrade project from .NET 2.0.2 to version 2.1.0

This file should be seen as a guide for migrating own code to OIORASP library 2.1.0
The guide might not be 100% accurate, depending on your use of the library! Some steps might be unnecessary in your setup, and others might be as detailed as need in your setup!

Steps
-----

1. Download new release from https://digitaliser.dk/group/405467/resources

2. Replace your old .dll files with the new .dll and .config files.
   Please note, there is several new file (IKVM and Saxon).
   Remove the 'dk.gov.oiosi.xml.dll' file (it is not used).

3. RaspConfiguration.xml must be updated!
   See RaspConfiguration-update-2.1.0.pdf

4. Code  updates:
   EndpointKeyTypeCode class has been removed. Now endpoint types is treated likes strings, so replace the class with 'string'.
   enum EndpointAddressTypeCode has been cleaned for unusable values (https, email, ftp and other)
   EndpointAddressSMTP.cs has been deleted.



That should be it..!
