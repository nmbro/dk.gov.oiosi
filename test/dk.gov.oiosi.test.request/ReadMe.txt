Instructions regarding dynamic configuration
----------------------------------------------

The xml files contained in this folder are dynamic configuration files used by the OIOSI library. 

If you would like to use the live UDDI/OCSP/LDAP servers, make sure that the file under the Live folder 
is copied to the folder from which the application is run.

If, instead, you would like to fake the UDDI/OCSP/LDAP calls, by using dummie lookup classes, make sure
that the file under the Live folder is copied to the folder from which the application is run.
